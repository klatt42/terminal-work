## Tips for Tomorrow

1. **Start with Morning Briefing** - See all uncommitted/unpushed work
2. **Tackle HIGH priority items first** - Git hygiene before new features
3. **Use multi-terminal setup** - Work on all 3 projects simultaneously
4. **Update dashboard regularly** - Run session-monitor.sh every hour
5. **Commit frequently** - Don't let uncommitted work pile up

**Good luck tomorrow! ðŸš€**

**Remember:** Each project has detailed NEXT_SESSION_TASKS.md for guidance
