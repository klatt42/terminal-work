# Aliases Installation Complete ✓

Your aliases are now installed and will work in **ALL terminals**.

---

## ✅ Installation Status

**Location**: Added to `~/.bashrc`
**Scope**: Works in all bash terminals (WSL, Claude Code terminal, Gemini CLI, Grok CLI, etc.)
**Effect**: Active in all NEW terminal sessions

---

## 🔄 How to Activate in Current Session

If you're in a terminal that was open BEFORE installation, run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This loads the aliases immediately. Or just open a new terminal tab/window.

## 📋 Available Aliases

### Quick Commits
```bash
qc "Add: message"         # Quick commit
commit "message"          # Same as qc
acp "Update: docs"        # Add all, commit, push in one command
qp                        # Quick push
```

### Morning & End of Day
```bash
morning                   # Morning briefing (shows all projects)
briefing                  # Same as morning
standup                   # Same as morning
eod                       # End of day workflow

```

### Context & Navigation
```bash
ctx                       # Sync AI context
sync-context              # Same as ctx
tw                        # Go to terminal-work
tws                       # Go to terminal-work + git status
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Aliases

Open a **NEW terminal** (or run `source ~/.bashrc`) and try:

```bash
# Test navigation
tw                        # Should take you to ~/projects/terminal-work

# Test morning briefing
morning                   # Shows "No briefing found" (until you run eod tonight)

# Test quick commit (dry run)
echo "test" > test.txt
qc "Test: verify alias works"
# Should prompt for push
```

---

## 🌍 Universal Availability

These aliases work in:

| Terminal Type | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| ✅ WSL Terminal | Works | Uses .bashrc |
| ✅ Claude Code Terminal | Works | Uses .bashrc |
| ✅ Gemini CLI | Works | Same shell environment |
| ✅ Grok CLI | Works | Same shell environment |
| ✅ Any bash terminal | Works | .bashrc is universal |

**Important**: They activate automatically when you open a NEW terminal. Current/existing terminals need `source ~/.bashrc`.

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Always use short aliases** - Type `qc` not `./scripts/quick-commit.sh`
2. **Morning routine** - First command each day: `morning`
3. **End of day** - Last command: `eod`
4. **Work anywhere** - Aliases work regardless of current directory

## 📖 Daily Workflow with Aliases

**Morning (9:00 AM)**
```bash
morning              # See all projects + yesterday's work
cd ~/projects/copilot-app   # Copy from briefing output
```

**During Day**
```bash
qc "Add: new feature"
qc "Update: styling"
qc "Fix: bug in auth"
```

**End of Day (5:00 PM)**
```bash
eod                  # Captures all projects, generates tomorrow's briefing
# Close all terminals safely!
```

**Next Morning**
```bash
morning              # Instant resume - see all project states
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Aliases not working?**
```bash
# Check if aliases are in .bashrc
cat ~/.bashrc | grep terminal-work

# Should show:
# source ~/projects/terminal-work/config/bash-aliases.sh

# Reload aliases
source ~/.bashrc

# Test
tw
```

**Want to see all aliases?**
```bash
alias | grep -E "(qc|eod|morning)"
```

**Uninstall aliases?**
```bash
# Edit .bashrc and remove the line
nano ~/.bashrc
# Delete: source ~/projects/terminal-work/config/bash-aliases.sh
```
