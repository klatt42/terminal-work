# Terminal Superuser Project Context

## Project Purpose
Multi-AI terminal orchestration and mastery project for learning and development.

## Stack
- WSL/Ubuntu
- Claude Code (primary AI orchestrator)
- Gemini CLI (secondary - fast iterations, large context)
- Grok CLI (tertiary - cost-effective, open-source)
- Voice commands (future integration)

## Current Focus
- Multi-AI orchestration patterns
- Terminal command mastery
- Voice integration planning
- Genesis SKILL development
- Cross-AI workflow optimization

## Development Guidelines
- Document all discovered patterns in TERMINAL_PATTERNS.md
- Benchmark AI performance across different tasks
- Create reusable workflows and automation
- Maintain cross-AI compatibility
- Build learning progression framework

## AI Assignment Strategy
- **Claude Code**: Architecture, complex reasoning, security analysis
- **Gemini CLI**: Documentation, large file analysis, quick prototyping
- **Grok CLI**: Code generation, testing, repetitive operations
