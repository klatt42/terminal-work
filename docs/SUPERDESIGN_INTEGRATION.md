## What is SuperDesign?

SuperDesign is an open-source AI design agent that generates UI mockups, components, and wireframes from natural language prompts. Created by [@jasonzhou1993](https://twitter.com/jasonzhou1993) and [@jackjack_eth](https://twitter.com/jackjack_eth).

### Key Features

✅ **Product Mockups** - Complete responsive UI screens
✅ **UI Components** - Reusable elements with animations
✅ **Wireframes** - Low-fidelity layouts for rapid iteration
✅ **Design Forking** - Create variations and iterate
✅ **Parallel Generation** - Multiple design agents simultaneously
✅ **Local Storage** - All designs saved in `superdesign/` directory

## Integration with Multi-AI Orchestration

SuperDesign adds a **6th capability** to the terminal-work system:

| AI Assistant | Role | SuperDesign Use Case |
|--------------|------|---------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Primary orchestrator | Generate design specs, iterate on designs |
| **Gemini CLI** | Documentation | Document design systems, create design guides |
| **Grok CLI** | Code generation | Implement designs as React/Vue components |
| **Perplexity** | Research | Research UI/UX trends, design patterns |
| **Codex** | Implementation | Convert designs to production code |
| **SuperDesign** | Design generation | Create UI mockups, wireframes, components |

---

## Workflow: Design-First Feature Development

### Phase 1: Design (SuperDesign + Claude Code)
```bash
# Claude Code with SuperDesign MCP
"Generate 3 variations of a user profile dashboard UI"
```

**Output**: 3 HTML designs in `superdesign/design_iterations/`

### Phase 2: Review & Iterate (Claude Code)
```bash
"Show me the gallery of designs"
# Review in browser
"Iterate on profile-dashboard-v2.html with larger avatar and card layout"
```

### Phase 3: Documentation (Gemini CLI)
```bash
gemini "Document the design system from superdesign/design_iterations/profile-dashboard-v2.html"
```

### Phase 4: Implementation (Grok CLI or Codex)
```bash
grok "Convert superdesign/design_iterations/profile-dashboard-v2.html to React components"
```

### Phase 5: Integration (Claude Code)
```bash
claude "Use code-reviewer subagent to ensure design implementation matches specs"
```

---

## Example: Terminal Dashboard Design

### Generated Design
**File**: `superdesign/design_iterations/terminal-dashboard-v1.html`

**Features**:
- Multi-AI status cards with hover effects
- Validated workflows grid
- Quick action buttons
- Metrics dashboard
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Terminal-inspired color scheme

**View**: Open in browser:
```bash
xdg-open superdesign/design_iterations/terminal-dashboard-v1.html
```

## 3 Ways to Make Stunning Websites (SuperDesign Method)

Based on `/mnt/c/Users/RonKlatt_3qsjg34/Desktop/Terminal-Work/Comm Folder/3 Ways to Make GENUINELY Stunning Websites Using Claude Code (2).md`:

### Method 1: SuperDesign Interactive Canvas
**Best for**: Original designs, rapid iteration

**Workflow**:
1. Open SuperDesign canvas: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "superdesign: open canvas"
2. Prompt: "Design a modern SaaS landing page"
3. Iterate in real-time with drag-and-drop
4. Export code or copy prompts

### Method 2: Pre-built Component Libraries
**Best for**: Fast development, consistent UI

**Tools**:
- **Shad CN UI** - Pre-built React components
- **Shad CN MCP** - MCP server for component integration
- **Tweak CN** - Customize component themes

**Workflow**:
1. Use Shad CN MCP to browse components
2. Generate SuperDesign wireframe
3. Map wireframe to Shad CN components
4. Customize with Tweak CN

### Method 3: Clone & Adapt Existing Designs
**Best for**: Inspiration, proven patterns

**Tools**:
- **Firecrawl MCP** - Clone website structures
- **Figma MCP** - Import Figma designs
- **SuperDesign** - Adapt and iterate

**Workflow**:
1. Firecrawl MCP: Clone site structure
2. SuperDesign: Generate variations
3. Iterate on best variation
4. Implement with Grok/Codex

---

## SuperDesign Best Practices

### 1. Always Generate Variations
Request 3-5 variations to explore different design directions:
```
"Generate 5 variations of a pricing page: modern, minimal, gradient, glass, terminal"
```

### 2. Use Design Systems
Extract design systems for consistency:
```
"Extract design system from superdesign/design_iterations/landing-page-v3.html"
```

### 3. Iterate in Steps
Make incremental improvements:
```
"Iterate on dashboard-v1.html with:
1. Larger spacing between cards
2. Gradient backgrounds
3. Add hover animations"
```

### 4. Gallery Review
Always review designs in gallery before implementation:
```
"Show me the gallery of all dashboard designs"
```

### 5. Document Design Decisions
Use Gemini CLI to document why certain designs were chosen:
```
gemini "Create design decision document for profile-dashboard-v2.html explaining color choices, layout, and UX patterns"
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Appearing

**Solution 1**: Restart Claude Code completely
```bash
# Fully quit Claude Code (not just close window)
# Restart from terminal
code
```

**Solution 2**: Verify MCP configuration
```bash
cat ~/.claude-code/mcp-settings.json
# Ensure path is correct
```

**Solution 3**: Check MCP server build
```bash
cd /home/klatt42/projects/terminal-work/tools/superdesign-mcp
npm run build
chmod +x dist/index.js
```

### Designs Not Saving

**Solution**: Ensure workspace directory exists
```bash
mkdir -p /home/klatt42/projects/terminal-work/superdesign/design_iterations
mkdir -p /home/klatt42/projects/terminal-work/superdesign/design_system
```

### Permission Errors

**Solution**: Set execute permissions
```bash
chmod +x /home/klatt42/projects/terminal-work/tools/superdesign-mcp/dist/index.js
```
