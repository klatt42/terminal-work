## 🚀 Quick Reference

**When you resume tomorrow, prioritize:**

1. **Option K (LLM Selector)** - Quick win with immediate cost savings (1-2 hours)
2. **Option B (PRD Tracker)** - Most immediate value, builds on handoff system
3. **Option C (AI Router)** - High impact for multi-AI workflow

**Medium-term projects:**
- Option L (File Upload) - Enables RAG workflows (2-3 hours)
- Option D (Error Learning) - Long-term productivity boost
- Option M (RAG Agent) - Requires Option L first (4-8 hours)

**Low-hanging fruit:**
- Option H (Analytics) - Can start collecting data immediately
- Option I (Documentation) - Can piggyback on existing systems

**Long-term projects:**
- Option E (Pair Programming) - Complex but high value
- Option F (Cross-Project Intelligence) - Requires significant data collection
- Option G (Voice Control) - Cool but not critical

## 📝 Notes

- All options are independent and can be implemented in any order
- Some options (B, C, D) can be implemented in phases
- Consider user feedback after Option A and J deployment
- Some options may naturally combine:
  - H + I (Analytics + Documentation)
  - D + F (Error Learning + Cross-Project Intelligence)
  - L + M (File Upload + RAG Agent) - sequential dependency
  - K + C (LLM Selector + AI Router) - complementary features

**Dependencies:**
- Option M (RAG Agent) requires Option L (File Upload) to be completed first
- Option K (LLM Selector) leverages existing OpenRouter and Ollama accounts

**Recent user requests (2025-10-31):**
> "I'd like to create a LLM selector capability for agent work... OpenRouter and Ollama Desktop installed... stepping to Haiku 4.5 rather than Sonnet 4.5 will save tokens"
> "MD response to an HTML tab... static HTML... easier to see and scroll"
> "File upload feature... Windows → WSL... RAG via Archon OS"
> "RAG agent using Archon for parsing, chunking, vector storage"

All noted and added to roadmap as Options K, L, M!
