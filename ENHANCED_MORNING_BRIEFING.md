# Enhanced Morning Briefing - New Features

## Overview

The morning briefing has been significantly enhanced with **real-time project scanning** that shows uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, and active terminal sessions.

**Date Enhanced**: 2025-10-29 Evening
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

---

## What's New

### 1. Real-Time Project Scan 🔍

Instead of static information from yesterday's EOD, the morning briefing now scans **all projects in real-time** when you run it.

**Shows**:
- ⚠️ Projects with uncommitted changes
- ⬆️ Projects with unpushed commits
- 📝 Number of uncommitted files (with preview)
- 🔀 Current branch
- 💬 Unpushed commit messages (last 3)
- 🚀 Exact `cd` command to jump to project

### 2. Active Terminal Sessions 🖥️

**Detects**:
- Tmux sessions (if any)
- Running AI processes (Claude, Gemini, Grok)
- Number of active AI instances

### 3. Priority Alerts 🎯

Automatically prioritizes your attention:
- **⚠️ ATTENTION NEEDED** section if you have uncommitted/unpushed work
- Suggests actions: commit now or continue work
- Quick action commands highlighted

### 4. Color-Coded Output 🎨

- **Red** (⚠️): Projects needing attention
- **Yellow**: Headers and important info
- **Green**: Action commands and success
- **Cyan**: Metadata and details
- **Blue**: Section dividers

## Command Comparison

### Old Morning Briefing:
```bash

```bash
morning
# Shows:
# - LIVE scan of all projects RIGHT NOW
# - Current uncommitted changes
# - Current unpushed commits
# - Active terminal sessions
# - Running AI processes
# - Yesterday's summary (if available)
```

## New Commands

### Morning Briefing

morning          # Enhanced real-time briefing
briefing         # Same as morning
standup          # Same as morning
```

### Project Scan (Standalone)
```bash
scan             # Run project scan only
status           # Same as scan
```

### Dashboard
```bash
dashboard        # Open interactive dashboard
monitor          # Update dashboard data
dash             # Short for dashboard
```

---

## What Gets Scanned

### Per Project:
1. **Git Status**
   - Uncommitted files (shows first 5)
   - Modified, added, deleted files
   - Untracked files marked with ??

2. **Unpushed Commits**
   - Count of commits ahead of origin
   - Last 3 commit messages
   - Detects if branch isn't on remote yet

3. **Current Branch**
   - Shows active branch name
   - Useful for multi-branch workflows

4. **Exact Resume Command**
   - Full `cd` path provided
   - Copy/paste ready

### System Status:
- **Tmux Sessions**: All active sessions listed
- **AI Processes**: Count of Claude, Gemini, Grok instances
- **Terminal Count**: Number of active shells

---

## Use Cases

### Morning Startup
```bash
# After PC restart
morning

# See exactly what needs attention:
# - Projects with uncommitted work
# - Projects with unpushed commits
# - Where you left off yesterday
```

### After Hibernation
```bash
# PC woke up from hibernation
morning

# Instant status of:
# - What got committed before sleep
# - What's still uncommitted
# - Which projects need pushing
```

### Mid-Day Context Switch
```bash
# Been working for a while, lost track
morning

# Quick overview:
# - All active projects
# - What needs committing
# - What needs pushing
```

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Just want to see project status
scan

# Or
status
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. No Stale Data
- **Problem**: EOD captures state at night, but you may work in the morning before running morning briefing
- **Solution**: Real-time scan shows current state, not yesterday's

### 2. Multi-Project Visibility
- See all 4 projects at once
- terminal-work
- rok-copilot
- amplify-engine
- bullseye-archon-enhanced

### 3. Prevents Lost Work
- Reminds you of uncommitted changes
- Shows unpushed commits before you close terminals
- Acts as safety net

### 4. Fast Context Switching
- Exact `cd` commands provided
- See branch names instantly
- Recent commit messages for context

---

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Morning Routine:
```bash
# 1. Boot up / open terminal
morning

# 2. Review output
# See what needs attention

# 3. Jump to project
cd ~/projects/terminal-work    # (copy from output)

# 4. View dashboard if needed
dashboard
```

### Throughout Day:
```bash
# Quick check
scan

# Or full briefing
morning
```

### End of Day:
```bash
# Run EOD (still captures everything)
eod

# Tomorrow morning will show:
# - Yesterday's summary (from EOD)
# - PLUS real-time scan of current state
```

---

## Files Created

1. **Enhanced Morning Briefing Script**
   - `scripts/morning-briefing.sh`
   - Real-time scanning
   - Color-coded output
   - Full project analysis

2. **Standalone Project Scan**
   - `scripts/scan-projects.sh`
   - Can be run independently
   - Quick status check

3. **Updated Aliases**
   - `config/bash-aliases.sh`
   - Added: `scan`, `status`
   - Updated: `morning` function

---

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Scans `~/projects/*`**
   - Finds all directories
   - Checks for `.git` folder

2. **For Each Git Repo**:
   ```bash
   git status -s                    # Uncommitted files
   git log origin/branch..branch    # Unpushed commits
   git branch --show-current        # Current branch
   ```

3. **Checks System State**:
   ```bash
   tmux ls                          # Active tmux sessions
   ps aux | grep "claude|gemini"    # AI processes
   ```

4. **Formats Output**:
   - Color codes based on status
   - Limits output (first 5 files, 3 commits)
   - Provides exact commands

### Performance
- **Scan Time**: ~1-2 seconds for 4 projects
- **Output**: Clean, organized, actionable
- **Memory**: Minimal (pure bash)

---

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Enhancement:
```bash
morning
# Shows:
# - Static summary from yesterday
# - Generic project list
# - No real-time status
# - Miss uncommitted changes
```

### After Enhancement:
```bash
morning
# Shows:
# - LIVE status of all projects
# - Uncommitted files with preview
# - Unpushed commits with messages
# - Exact resume commands
# - Active terminal count
# - Yesterday's summary too
```

## Summary

The enhanced morning briefing provides:

✅ **Real-time project scanning** (not just yesterday's data)
✅ **Uncommitted changes detection** with file preview
✅ **Unpushed commits detection** with messages
✅ **Active sessions monitoring** (tmux, AI processes)
✅ **Color-coded output** for quick scanning
✅ **Exact resume commands** (copy/paste ready)
✅ **Priority alerts** for attention needed
✅ **Quick reference** of useful commands

**Use it anytime** - morning, afternoon, after hibernation, or whenever you need to see what's happening across all your projects!

---

**Command to try it now**:
```bash
morning
```

**Safe to use**: Non-destructive, read-only scanning. Just shows status, doesn't change anything.
